what is "this"?

"this" is a reference which refers to the current or invoking object.

What is the importance of "this"?
	when u create multiple objects, u have those many copies of instance members however , u have only one copy of member function/s. In that case how will member function keep a track of invoking object ? 
	member function/s will come to know about invoking or current object through "this" reference.

can we use "this" with static members?
	no because this refers to object and static are not associated with objects.


How can we use "this" keyword in program?
	
	private String name;
	public void setName(String name)
	{
		this.name=name;
	}

here "this.name" is an instance member and "name" is a local member.
